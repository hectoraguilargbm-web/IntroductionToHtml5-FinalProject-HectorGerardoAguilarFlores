    <a href=""> 0:06</a> <p> Earlier, I showed you how you can open the Visual Studio Code editor. Let's go ahead and go back and actually create something real that has been using the tags that we've been talking about. The minimum requirements that I'm going to want you to have is one, create a real page and make sure to call it "index.html". Remember, "index.html" is the default name that all the browsers know to look for when it goes to open up your site. I want your page to utilize the header, main, and footer elements. Hey, don't cheat. These elements should not be empty. </p>
    <br>
    <a href="">0:45</a> <p>Take this as a chance to create something interesting. Then finally, as always, want you to make sure that your page validates. Go in to the W3 validator and/or the WAVE validator to take a look and see what's going on. Make sure to start with the shell. The shell includes your doctype, any metadata, that's the head section, as well as your displayable content. In the past, it was up to you to remember how to put that all in. But thanks to Visual Studio Code and Replit, this will all be built-in to the shell when you open up your editor. </p>
    <br>
    <a href="">1:25</a> <p>I'm going to give you some examples, but I really encourage you to take what I'm about to do and make it your own. The first step is to create a new file. I'm going to call mine "index.html". It's going to go in my folder and then we've got it. Step 2 is show off those super programming skills. Makes you feel like you're in some sort of movie where they're typing a little bit and amazing things are happening. I'm going to type the exclamation point and Tab. </p>
    <br>
    <a href="">1:58</a> <p> It has now put the shell of my program in for me. It has put in that I want HTML5. It has put in the head data, which includes all this cool stuff about what it should look like on a phone versus a laptop that we're not really using yet. Let's say I'm going to make this document about "My Favorite Foods." In the body, I'm going to use the main tag because I know that accessibility checkers are going to be looking for main. So I'm going to put that in here. I'm going to include an h1 tag because h1 tags really make things pop and they help our users know what my page is about. </p>
